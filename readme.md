# Beers
This little web-app is both a tool to 'scratch my own itch' and a learning device to help discover the ins-and-outs of modern web application development. I'm hoping to go from Javascript noob to pro* during this process.

*Potentially. 

## Todo:
* Implement templates with Mustache JS in order to reduce yanky code to build up form elements etc 
* Use sessionStorage rather than PHP sessions for confirming whether a user is logged in or not
* Validation on inputs
* Auto-suggest from previous entries when entering a beer

Any feedback welcome at beerapp@danmatthew.co.uk

Cheers,
Dan
