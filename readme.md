# [Beers](http://danmatthew.co.uk/beers)

## Update: 12th May
App is now live! Register and start using. I'm happy to receive any feedback.

This little web-app is both a tool to 'scratch my own itch' and a learning device to help discover the ins-and-outs of modern web application development. I'm hoping to go from Javascript noob to pro* during this process.

*Potentially. 


## Todo:
* Start generating and displaying stats: highest rated beer, most popular beer yadda yadda
* ~~Implement templates with Mustache JS in order to reduce yanky code to build up form elements etc~~
Not a fan of this now: I don't like having to use innerHTML for the various actions. It feels sluggish when adding a list item, plus pagination reveals tell-tale flicker :( 
* Use sessionStorage rather than PHP sessions for confirming whether a user is logged in or not
* ~~Validation/sanitation on inputs
* Auto-suggest from previous entries when entering a beer
* Search? Wouldn't it be cool to get to the bar and quickly discover the description and user ratings of a particular beer?

Any feedback welcome at beerapp@danmatthew.co.uk

Cheers,
Dan
